# RestaurantAssistantAPI

The idea is to create an AI-powered restaurant assistant that works through a chat system. The application is designed to help restaurants save employees’ time by automatically answering guests’ frequently asked questions.

Another feature I’m implementing is the ability to book tables directly through the AI chatbot—convenient, right?

The assistant will provide information specific to the restaurant it belongs to and also handle reservations.

This particular repo includes a simple API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting the following entities in the database:

Clients

Restaurants

Restaurant Tables

Bookings

Business Days

I’m still actively developing this project, so stay tuned for updates!
